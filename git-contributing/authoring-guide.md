## Authoring Guide for ExCl

Perhaps you've got some how-to documents tucked away in folders that you'd like to share with the community. Or maybe you've discovered a way of doing things that would benefit other users.

You can submit your user guides for publication within the [ExCl documentation site](https://docs.excl.ornl.gov)! See the [contributing](../excl-support/contributing.md) page for instructions.

We've assembled here the fundamental authoring guidelines for ExCl user documentation.

### Document and Content Preferences

* Documents should be created using [markdown](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html) using the [commonmark](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#transitioning-to-commonmark) syntax.
* Oak Ridge National Laboratory \(ORNL\) uses the [_Chicago Manual of Style_](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html) \(_CMOS_\) as a basic style guide.
* Define the first instance of every acronym in each document. Ensure that the long-form is not repeated after it is defined.
* Buttons and links that the user should "click" should go in `code`. For example, "Next, click the `Manage Rules` button."
* Put `&#128221;` in front of NOTES. Renders: üìù
* Use `&#9662;` for those "carrot" drop-down menus. Renders: ‚ñæ
* For headings: only use title case for the first three heading levels, `#`, `##`, and `###`. The remaining header levels should be sentence case.

### Pictures and Images

Screenshots and images cannot be resized using markdown. Therefore, we embed `.html` that is rendered when we publish the tutorial to the documentation site.

* Images and screenshots should be stored in a folder`.gitbook/assets`.
* Files should be named descriptively. For example, use names such as `adding-IP-address.png` instead of `image03.png`.
* To remain consistent with other images in tutorials, please use the following `.html` code to resize, add a border, and open in a new browser tab when clicked. Note that you'll need to change the file name twice in the following code.

  ```text
  <a target="_new" href="/.gitbook/assets/ssh_import_pub_key.png"><img src="screenshots/ssh_import_pub_key.png" style="border-style:ridge;border-color:#bfbfbf;border-width:1px;width:550px;" /></a>
  ```

### Other Considerations

* Have you redacted sensitive information from text and images?
* Have you removed information that is protected by copyright?
* Are you using a specific version of your software and have you included in the documentation?

### ExCL Brand Guide
