## Access to ExCL

To become authorized to access ExCL facilities, apply at
 <https://excl.ornl.gov/accessing-excl/>.  You have the option of
using your ORNL (ucams) account if you have one, or creating an xcams
(external user) account if you wish.

Once you have access you have a couple of options.
-   login.excl.ornl.gov runs an sshd service.
-   There is a limited number of ThinLInc licenses available. Thinlinc
   (Xfce Desktop) can be accessed at <https://login.excl.ornl.gov:300> for
   HTML5 services, and ThinLinc clients can use login.excl.ornl.gov
   as their destination.
