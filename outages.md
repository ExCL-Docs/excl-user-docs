## Periodic Maintenance Outages

ExCL reserves the first Tuesday of every month for systems maintenance.  This may result in complete inaccessibility during business hours.  Every effort will be made to minimize the scope, duration, and effect of maintenance activities.

If an outage will affect urgent projects (i.e., with impending deadlines) please email excl-help@ornl.gov as soon as possible.

### Outage Reservation Thursday August 6, 2019

There will be a brief period where the file server is not available.
This should not require any logouts or reboots.
This outage will be to move fs00 from a single 10gb interface to a bonded
10g interface, for both performance and reliability.
