# Outages and Maintenance Policy

ExCL reserves the first Tuesday of every month for systems maintenance. This may result in complete inaccessibility during business hours. Every effort will be made to minimize the scope, duration, and effect of maintenance activities.

If an outage will affect urgent projects (i.e., with impending deadlines) please email excl-help@ornl.gov as soon as possible.
