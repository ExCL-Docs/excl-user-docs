# Access to ExCL

To become authorized to access ExCL facilities, please apply at [https://excl.ornl.gov/accessing-excl/](https://excl.ornl.gov/accessing-excl/). You have the option of using your ORNL \(ucams\) account if you have one, or creating an xcams \(external user\) account if you wish.

Once you have access you have a couple of options.

* login.excl.ornl.gov runs an sshd service.
* There is a limited number of [ThinLinc](https://www.cendio.com/thinlinc/what-is-thinlinc) licenses available. Thinlinc \(Xfce Desktop\) can be accessed at [https://login.excl.ornl.gov:300](https://login.excl.ornl.gov:300) for HTML5 services, and ThinLinc clients can use login.excl.ornl.gov as their destination.  ThinLinc clients can be downloaded without cost from [https://www.cendio.com/thinlinc/download](https://www.cendio.com/thinlinc/download).  ThinLinc provideds much better performance than tunneling X over ssh. A common stratagy is to access login.excl.ornl.gov via ThinLinc and then use X11 forwarding to access GUIs running on other nodes.
