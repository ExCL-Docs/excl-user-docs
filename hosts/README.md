This is basic host and device information for FTG.

I've not decided how to structure it, other than to 

-   have a file per host with all pertinant information

-   have a file per speciality device with pertinant information
    and link back to host where it is installed (if any)

-   have a block output from inxi -v 2 which pretty much tells everything
    that is installed.
