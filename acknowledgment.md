# Acknowledgment

Please acknowledge in your publications the role the Experimental Computing Laboratory \(ExCL\) facility played in your research. Alerting us when a paper is accepted is also appreciated.

Sample acknowledgment:

> This research used resources of the Experimental Computing Laboratory \(ExCL\) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725

You may use any variation on this theme, calling out specific simulations or portions of the research that used ExCL resources, or citing specific resources used.

However, the crucial elements to include are:

* The spelled out center name \(it's okay to include the acronym, too\): Experimental Computing Laboratory \(ExCL\)
* Office of Science and U.S. Department of Energy
* Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725

We appreciate your conscientiousness in this matter. Acknowledgment and pre-publication notification helps ExCL communicate the importance of its role in science to our sponsors and stakeholders, helping assure the continued availability of this valuable resource.
