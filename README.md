## Emergency maintenance outage for leconte on June 27 and 28.

Leconte will be down all day Thursday June 27 and Friday June 28 for cooling system maintenance.   We will make this system available as soon as is possible.


## Periodic Maintenance Outages

ExCL reserves the first Tuesday of every month for systems maintenance.  This may result in complete inaccessibility during business hours.  Every effort will be made to minimize the scope, duration, and effect of maintenance activities.

If an outage will affect urgent projects (i.e., with impending deadlines) please email excl-help#ornl.gov as soon as possible.

### Scheduled Outage Tuesday July 2, 2019

On Tuesday July 2, the following maintenance activities are planned:

*  The system hosting VM services for ExCL will be updated, rebooted, and some delayed maintenance will take place.  This will result in all ExCL systems being inaccessible during this period. Best effort will be made to restore these systems by noon.
*  The ExCL file server will be updated and rebooted.
* All other systems will be rebooted to apply already performed updates (primarily kernel updates that are pending reboot).

### Outage Reservation Thursday August 6, 2019

No outage is anticipated for this date.
