[Apptainer/Singularity](https://apptainer.org/) is the most widely used container system for HPC. It is designed to execute applications at bare-metal performance while being secure, portable, and 100% reproducible. Apptainer is an open-source project with a friendly community of developers and users. The user base continues to expand, with Apptainer/Singularity now used across industry and academia in many areas of work.

[Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/1.0/introduction.html) is a _container_ platform. It allows you to create and run containers that package up pieces of software in a way that is portable and reproducible. You can build a container using Apptainer on your laptop, and then run it on many of the largest HPC clusters in the world, local university or company clusters, a single server, in the cloud, or on a workstation down the hall. Your container is a single file, and you don’t have to worry about how to install all the software you need on each different operating system.

Apptainer allows for more secure containers than docker without the need for root access.
