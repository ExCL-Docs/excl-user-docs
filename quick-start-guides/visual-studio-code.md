# Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code or VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. The editor has IntelliSense, debugger support, built-in git, and many extensions to add additional support to the editor. VSCode supports [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) and development on remote servers via ssh. Plugins add language support, linters, and compilers for many languages including Python, C/C++, CMake, and markdown.
