# Siemens EDA

The EDA tools are installed on the system `dragon`. `dragon` can be access via ssh from the `login` node, via x11 forwarding from the login node's ThinLink, or directly via ThinLink with Foxy Proxy. See [ThinLinc Quickstart](ThinLinc.md) to get started with ThinLinc Setup.

All of the tools are installed to `/opt/Siemens` and the tools can be set up with `source /opt/Siemens/setup.sh`.
